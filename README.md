Coding Temple - Software Engineering Course - Peter Pastor

This entire repository is a collection of all the assignments and projects I've done during my Software Engineering Bootcamp Course with Coding Temple. As I write this, I'm still very new to GitHub. I do understand the importance of version control but fear that I'm not saving my work in the appropriate manner. As for now, 02.28.2026, I have finalized my Final Project in the HTML/CSS Module and have submitted it. To view any of my work, please pull any of the sub-directories and view the files of the specific assignment/project. 

HTML/CSS - Final Project (sub-directory) - 02.28.2026 
You can pull the entire sub-directory and open the index.html file. All coding was done by myself and I used a local image folder instead of image files that were pulled from an online website. This way, the image files are local and not based on linked images that may possibly deleted. I hope you enjoy the small website.
